# JavaScript Loops – Practice Assignments

This folder contains my practice assignments based on **loops in JavaScript**.  
It includes small programs that helped me understand and apply:

- `for` loop  
- `while` loop  
- `do...while` loop  
- Nested loops  
- Looping over arrays & strings

---

## What’s Included

Each file focuses on a specific problem using loops, such as:

- Printing number sequences (even, odd, reverse order, etc.)
- Calculating sums (e.g., sum of 1 to N)
- Finding factorial of a number
- Generating multiplication tables
- Simple pattern printing using `*`
- Basic array iteration and operations

> 📁 Every `.html` / `.js` file is a separate small assignment to practice loop logic.

## How to Run the Code

You can run these programs in multiple ways:

### 1. Using a Browser (HTML + JS)

1. Open any `.html` file from the `Loops` folder.
2. Right-click and select **Open with → Browser** (Chrome, Edge, etc.).
3. Open **Developer Tools → Console** (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`) to see the output if it is logged using `console.log()`.

### 2. Using the Browser Console Only

1. Open your browser.
2. Press `F12` → go to the **Console** tab.
3. Copy the JavaScript code from the `.js` file.
4. Paste it into the console and press **Enter**.

### 3. Using VS Code (Recommended)

1. Open this project folder in **VS Code**.
2. Install the **Live Server** extension (optional but helpful).
3. Right-click on an `.html` file → **Open with Live Server** to run it in the browser.

## Purpose of This Folder

- Practice core **loop concepts** in JavaScript.
- Improve problem-solving and logic building.
- Build a strong foundation for future topics like arrays, objects, and algorithms.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add comments in each file explaining the logic step by step.
- Add more problems like:
  - Number patterns
  - Prime numbers
  - Palindrome checks
- Connect some programs with simple HTML UI (input fields & buttons).
